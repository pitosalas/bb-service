				<p>While its certainly been a long process in the making, we&#8217;re now quite excited to announce <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html">OpenID Authentication 2.0</a> and <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-attribute-exchange-1_0.html">OpenID Attribute Exchange 1.0</a> as final specifications (&#8221;OpenID 2.0&#8243;). This morning was the closing day of <a href="http://iiw.windley.com/wiki/Workshop_2007b" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outbound/iiw.windley.com/wiki/Workshop_2007b');">the Internet Identity Workshop</a> and David Recordon, Dick Hardt, and Josh Hoyt (three of the authors and editors) made the announcement during the first session. Both specifications have evolved through extensive community participation and feedback and each have been stable for a number of months. There are already a variety of open source libraries shipping these specifications with product support including Google&#8217;s Blogger (via Sxip&#8217;s library) and Drupal who did their own implementation of the specifications.  Multiple OpenID Providers including <a href="http://www.myopenid.com/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outbound/www.myopenid.com/');">MyOpenID</a>, <a href="http://www.sxipper.com/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outbound/www.sxipper.com/');">Sxipper</a>, and <a href="http://pip.verisignlabs.com/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outbound/pip.verisignlabs.com/');">VeriSign&#8217;s PIP</a> already have support for both of these specifications. Given past trends, growing support of OpenID 2.0 should be no different. Today the following libraries exist which implement OpenID Authentication 1.1 and 2.0, OpenID Attribute Exchange 1.0, and OpenID Simple Registration 1.0:</p>

</ul>
<p>As part of the IPR work over the past few months we&#8217;ve <a href="http://openid.net/ipr/Non-Assertion-Agreement/executed/">collected</a> non-assertion agreements from contributors to both of these specifications as well as all past specifications. These agreements are a way for contributors (and others) to formally declare that they will not assert any patent rights against OpenID implementations.  You can learn more about the IPR work underway at <a href="http://openid.net/foundation/intellectual-property/">http://openid.net/foundation/intellectual-property/</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that this has been the work of many folks not only within the OpenID community but also the OpenID Foundation, AOL, Cordance, JanRain, Microsoft, NetMesh, Six Apart, Sxip, Sun Microsystems, Symantec, Verisign and Yahoo!.  Microsoft was instrumental in helping with legal support and guidance combined with the insight of Sun and Yahoo! with their joint work in developing the right language. This is great news as it means that today not only is OpenID 2.0 final, but all of the contributors have sent a strong message that OpenID must be freely implementable world-wide.</p>
<p>We certainly invite you to come and join the conversation and the community on <a href="http://openid.net/mailman/listinfo/general">general@openid.net</a>.</p>

This has been a long time coming but it certainly worth the wait. Okay, great.  Now what?  Adoption is going to be the key.  Chris calls out his shit, wish and hitlist for 2008 and he’s dead-on.  We’ll get there, but its this type of grassroots evangelism is what we need.  We’re a long way from where we want/need to be, but not to worry. OpenID to me has always been a key component to what the “open web” is all about.  Its a building block.  Just like microformats or OAuth.  There are a lot more to come.  We’re just getting started here.  We already have the basic vocabulary we need now to do some very interesting things.  OpenID, OAuth and microformats set the stage.  2008 will be about some of the exciting things this empowers as well as the next generation of technologies, standards and tools. With the crazy high valuations and talk about all of this social networking stuff, people literally forget to talk about the the consumers and what this means to them.  The “open web” is all about the consumer and they will be the winner in all of this.  It won’t be Facebook, it won’t be MySpace, etc.  Data wants to be free.  Users want choice.  That means not only will the consumer win, there will be unbelievable competition in this market.  Nothing bad can come from that … :-)' onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outbound/kveton.com/blog/2007/12/11/openid-20-final-what-does-that-mean/');">Scott Kveton: OpenID 2.0 final: What does that mean?</a></li><li><a class='kbrsswidget' href='http://itickr.com/?p=101' title='I’m back from IIW2007B. As always, there was a lot of energy, lot of discussions and lot of networking.  OpenID 2.0 was announced. OAuth 1.0 was announced. There were quite a few sessions on VRM. Some good discussions on reputation around OPs, RPs and users. I also got to spend one afternoon in the OSIS session where the discussions have moved beyond the “happy path” and the vendors (me included) are ready to tackle the edge use cases around Information Cards. One of my favorite session was “What’s next for OpenID” led by Dick (Sxip) and Josh(JanRain). Now the OpenID 2.0 is wrapped and shipped, what needs to be improved for the next version(s). Here are my notes from the session: (if you were there and I have missed or misinterpreted anything, feel free to correct).  Single Sign Out:  OpenID allows the user to have a single identifier and get a single sign on experience across multiple applications. RP applications have different session time outs and this results in an inconsistent user experience as well as security issues.  The protocol should have a way to “single log out” from all the applications. Phishing resistant:  OpenID has a couple of security issues, phishing being the primary one. It’s very easy for a rogue RP to redirect the user to a fake IdP and steal his/her credentials. There are a few solutions e.g. firefox plugins but it will be nice to have support for it in the protocol (or at least a best practice or recommendation for providers). User experience less geeky:  It may seem easy to some but typing (and remembering) whatever.myfavoriteopenidprovider.com is confusing and cumbersome for non-geeky, non-identity people. Performance: Too many redirects. Direct authentication to the site using username/password results in a faster experience. Cardspace - OpenID integration:  CardSpace and OpenID are both addressing one fundamental problem - “Reducing Password overload”. Both have their strengths and weaknesses. It will be nice to have some convergence. Identifier control:  This is the identifier recycling issue plus some additional concerns. e.g I have my own domain name that I have redirected to my favorite OpenID provider. RPs may attach my identifier (i.e. my domain name) to my account at the RP. If I forget to renew my domain name (or I get hit by the bus), someone else may acquire my domain name and thus get access to my account at the RP. Non-browser authentication - Ability to authenticate to non-browser applications. Consolidation / Synonyms -  If a user has multiple OpenIDs, then the RPs should allow attaching multiple OpenIDs to the same account. Identifier management - The users may already have an OpenID identifier from AOL,Yahoo etc. but don’t know how to use it at the RP. This is a usability issue for the RP sites.  In the past, if you raise issues like “phishing”, the standard response was “this is a problem with SAML too” OR “this is out of scope for OpenID”.  It was refreshing to be able to openly discuss the weaknesses and figure out ways to improve the protocol. I consider this a sign of maturity.

Initially, they will be focussing on plugins for existing publishing platforms like WordPress and Drupal.  On the WordPress side, they are using wp-openid as a foundation to develop additional plugins that build on OpenID to bring other social functionality to WordPress powered blogs.  I am therefore pleased to announce that wp-openid is moving under the umbrella of DiSo in an effort to allow better integration with the other social plugins that are being developed, as well as get some other really smart people working on the code.  I’ve been working with Chris on various identity projects for a while now, and have been very impressed with Steve’s ability to really grok this topic, so I have no doubt this move will be good for all involved. Over the next week or two, I hope to get the wp-openid codebase migrated into the DiSo subversion repository.  The plan is to synchronize changes made there back over to wp-plugins.org so that the wordpress.org project page as well as plugin update notifications will continue to work as they do now.  Any existing bug reports at wp-plugins will also be moved over to Google Code, which should provide some better features and flexibility.  If you’re interested in following the progress of wp-openid or the other DiSo projects, feel free to join the DiSo Google Group.

Everything else, such as authentication, or attribute exchange, is, while often    very useful, architecturally optional. What services, other than authentication    or attribute exchange, might be useful? A ton, in my view ... for example, messaging. For example, we could, with very little effort, do an HTTP POST as part of an    OpenID authentication transaction, and carry arbitrary payload that is subject    to the OpenID authentication crypto, i.e. cannot be changed in transit and    whose sender address cannot be falsified. In other words, a replacement for e-mail that does not need to go through a lot    of legacy contortions (7bit, 72 characters, that kind of thing) and that,    best of all, does not allow spammers to fake the return address as a matter of    design. Sounds useful? Certainly James    McGovern thinks so. We certainly do, too. Which is why MyLID.net    has had that functionality for a long time now.
